# Agent-Sense
Algorithmic Design 
The procedure behind this work involves writing an algorithm that allows point agents to interact with a mesh surface. A mesh is then created as a response to the dimensions and the temporal conditions of the site, The Bartlett's own Wates House. Particular agents are then selected fromthe mesh object, and then the script is engaged, allowing the agents and their pathways to become self-referential. The agents have an assigned attraction to the mesh object but they also have a flocking behavior of between themselves. Amongst themselves, they align, cohere and separate. Finally, the agents have a radious of their own, which effects all of these parameters independently. 

The theory behind this work is focused on the agents' relationship to the Bartlett building entrance. This high traffic area is often regarded as a missing opportunity, not allowing for necessary happenings within an Architecture school, including public gathering or independent reflection. The installation does not alter the structural system, but rather provides space within space. The resulting surface treatment is a high resolution mesh, providing complexity, detail and practical protection form the elements. As a result, the solid block that was once Wates House becomes more human and a representation of the humans existing within: diverse, weird whimsical and maybe a little crazy.
